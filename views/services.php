					<b>Slicks Auto Repair was established in 1990 </b>
					Whether you're looking for mechanical repair, collision repair, or fleet service. 
					Slicks Auto Repair was established on a foundation of outstanding customer service 
					and quality workmanship. Whether you're looking for mechanical repair, collision repair,

					But we'd never expect to gain your business solely on an enthusiastic commitment. We back it up

					because it provides higher quality work and better service. That's just not true...and we're proof. 
					Come to Slicks Auto Repair and you'll find our staff is more knowledgeable than the dealership's, 
					our parts are of equal quality, our service is performed more personally and honestly, and we do it 
					all at a less expensive rate.
